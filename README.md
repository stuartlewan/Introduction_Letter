Hello!

Do you have a great opportunity for my experience and talent to help achieve your organization’s goals?  After spending some time on political work and family commitments, I’m ready to hit the ground running for my next challenge.

It’s hard to fit what I have to offer into the usual job search “boxes” and algorithms.  Whatever I do, I do with dedication and personal commitment, and with a deep respect for the trust placed in me. In person, I’ll probably surprise, and hopefully delight, you by exceeding whatever expectations these words on a screen might evoke.  I actively seek out how I can bring the most value to everything I do.

While I’ve excelled in technical roles throughout my entire career, one of the first things people notice about me is that I am highly conversant and knowledgable about business, the arts, politics and science.  Rather than stay narrowly focused on testing alone, I embrace opportunities to contribute to a project’s success in any way I can, providing “big picture” insight or casting a sophisticated eye to the smallest detail.

Somewhat of an extrovert and easy-going, I love being part of a great team pulling together and pushing each other to the next level, learning from one another, building trust and forming bonds.  Adapting my role as the project and organization evolve keeps things compelling. Wearing different hats as developments warrant inspires my best effort when given the chance to grow my responsibilities. 

The hype and curiosity around new technologies and products entering the mainstream  excites and inspires me, especially when the public will see my work on a national or global scale, even more so when recognized in the press and when winning awards.  My most thrilling professional accomplishments were launching innovative, engaging interactive experiences for some of the most recognized brands on the planet.  I “own” my work, and when it garners praise, I’m deeply personally gratified.

My maturity and loyalty keeps me grounded when things get hectic, and mentoring younger coworkers gives me a chance to pass it forward, and stabilize the team when the going gets tough.  Having spent my whole career working with the best and brightest drawn to new technologies makes me a great fit with all kinds of people of any age or background.

Let’s discuss ways that I can be an important part in your organization’s future successes. I’m open-minded about what kind of role would be best, but prior experience assures me that the possibilities are endless.

Stuart
